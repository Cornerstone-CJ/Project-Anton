# virtual-assistant-CJ

The Virtual Assistant CJ repository is a project worked on by the Cornerstone Team, that involves a challenge organized by the TWT team. This repository is constantly changing so be sure to check in in order to keep up with the updates. The project must be submitted by the 31st of January, 2021. So this repository will likely stop being updated after that point.
